this project tried to add an specified attribute to a selected node.
this is not well done now, because i cant do this to all kind of node....
i will finish this this week. 
this will be used to add yafaray components(materials, textures...)to a specified node.

how to install on windows:

1.follow the README.txt file step 1 and 2 in "load plug-in test" folder if you dont do this before.
  because no envoironment parameter or mel script added or changed.

3.open maya, then
  1>.window->Settings/Preferences->Plug-in Manager
  2>.click "Browse" on the left of the bottom, then go to where the testSelectAddAttribute.mll file is
  3>.then click "load"
  4>.^o^
